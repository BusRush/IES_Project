# BusRush

BusRush is web and mobile application that allows users to monitor bus statistics in real-time. This data – location, speed, fuel consumption, number of passengers - is collected using a device onboard of every bus, that periodically sends relevant information about its current state to the system, to be processed, stored or shown to end users. Using this real-time data in combination with static information such as bus schedules, the system can, for instance, provide an estimation for the time of arrival at any given stop - or the user’s closest stop, based on his current location.
